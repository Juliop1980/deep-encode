# AWT PJ WS 21/22 Deep Encode 2

Repository for training and evaluation of different machine learning models to reduce the number of test encodes needed to identify the optimal encoding settings.

There is a ReadMe.md for every Machine Learning Algorithm, just press on your prefered machine learning Algorithm.

## About Deep Encode
![](docs/images/DeepEncode.png)
Video streaming content differs in terms of complexity and requires title-specific encoding settings to achieve a certain visual quality. Per-title encoding enables a more efficient and tailored video encoding ladder based on the complexity of a video. To take things a step further, per-scene encoding enables tailored video encoding ladders based on the complexity of each scene, rather than an entire video. However, conventional encoding solutions, such as per-title and per-scene, are computationally heavy and required a high amount of test encodes to identify the optimal encoding settings. The Deep Encode project utilizes machine learning models and provides encoding setting predictions in order to avoid the computationally heavy test encodes.

### Features
The scripts contained in this folder allow to:

1. Build a Gradient Boosting Decision Tree model and predict VMAF values using it.
2. Plot the data points(Bitrate/predcted VMAF) and calculate the convex hull in order to see how one resolution outperforms the other at a certain bitrate.
3. Build the encodding ladder and get the higher VMAF value at a certain bitrate using it.

### Development
Python:
The development is done using Python 3.9.7. The required moduls are matplotlib, numpy, pandans, scikit-learn, scipy.
R:
The development is done using R 4.1.0. The required moduls are dummies, ggplot2, metrics, ggally, dplyr,tidyr,forecast, ggmap, datetime, fpc

## Run
### Build and Train the model
Python:
The script model-new.py builds the GBDT model and predicts the VMAF values.

to run this script:
`python model-new.py` 

R:
The script dataInR.rmd builds the Linear Regression model and predicts the VMAF values.

Run All 
### Plot bitrate/VMAF pairs
PYthon:
The script plot_bitrate_vmaf.py plots the data points(bitrate, predicted VMAF) and calculates the convexhull for each video ID.

to run this script:
`python plot_bitrate_vmaf.py`

R:
The dataFrame encoddingLadderFinished contains the final EncodingLadder (videoID, bitrate, resolution, maxVMAF)
### Build encoding ladder
The script build_encoding_ladder.py builds the bitrate/VMAF ladders for each video ID.

to run this script:
`python build_encoding_ladder.py`

R:
The dataFrame encoddingLadderFinished contains the final EncodingLadder (videoID, bitrate, resolution, maxVMAF)

### Convex hull ###

The ConvexHull Graphs are saved as .png in the Folder.
