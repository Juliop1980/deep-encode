# AWT PJ WS 21/22 Deep Encode 2

Repository for training and evaluation of different machine learning models to reduce the number of test encodes needed to identify the optimal encoding settings.

## About Deep Encode

Video streaming content differs in terms of complexity and requires title-specific encoding settings to achieve a certain visual quality. Per-title encoding enables a more efficient and tailored video encoding ladder based on the complexity of a video. To take things a step further, per-scene encoding enables tailored video encoding ladders based on the complexity of each scene, rather than an entire video. However, conventional encoding solutions, such as per-title and per-scene, are computationally heavy and required a high amount of test encodes to identify the optimal encoding settings. The Deep Encode project utilizes machine learning models and provides encoding setting predictions in order to avoid the computationally heavy test encodes.
